# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! My aim with this repository is to share my knowledge and document my journey as I dive deep into the world of DSA.

## About
Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamentals of any programming language. Understanding these can be a major tool when it comes to solving complex problems. In this repository, I am focusing on learning, exploring, and implementing various data structures and algorithms with the aim of improving problem-solving skills.

## Goals
- To understand the importance of data structures and algorithms.
- To analyze algorithms (time and space complexity).
- To implement data structures and algorithms.
- To solve problems using data structures and algorithms.

## Languages 
The implementations for DSA in this repository are primarily done in the following languages:
- Python
- Java
- C++

However, the core logic remains the same, and hence, these solutions can be translated into any other programming language.
