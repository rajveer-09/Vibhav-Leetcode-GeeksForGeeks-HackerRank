Q) In the given snippet, we have an array called 'arr' which is sorted in ascending order. The 'lower_bound' of a number 'x' in the array is defined as the smallest index 'idx' such that the value 'arr[idx]' is not less than 'x'.

If all the numbers in the array are smaller than 'x', then the 'lower_bound' of 'x' would be equal to the size 'n' of the array.

It is important to note that indexing in the array starts from 0.

// solution :

public class Solution {
    public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        for (int i = 0 ;i<arr.length; i ++) {
            if (arr[i] >= x) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }
}
